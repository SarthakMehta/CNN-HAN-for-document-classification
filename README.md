# CNN-HAN-for-document-classification
We propose a neural architecture for the document
classification problem where we utilize a hybrid neural structure
which is a three-layered structure - first, a character level
convolutional neural layer, next layer is an attention layer to get
word level representation from characters, the third layer is a
recurrent neural network structure/(again convolutional neural
network) in order to get a get sentence level representation and
finally we have interconnected dense structure stacked to classify the
document. 
## Data Set
[IMDB dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz) 

## Setup Instructions 
Steps for executing the code are as follows
1) Download the dataset from the above link
2) Extract the data 
3) put code(.py files) and extracted folder(aclimdb) in same folder
4) run python code by command python codename.py
